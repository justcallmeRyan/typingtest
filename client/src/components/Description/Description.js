You can quickly see how fast you can type and compare your result with your friends. <br/> <br/>One huge benefit: The more you use our typing game, the faster you will be able to type as the typing test uses the top 200 words of each language. If you are able to type the most frequent words faster, you will be able to type everything else faster as well!</h3>
